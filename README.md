# Algorithm Design and Analysis — Course Materials

This repository contains slides, coursework, and supplementary materials for the "Algorithm Design and Analysis" course.

**Repository Purpose**: Store and share lecture slides, problem sets, solution sketches, code examples, and other resources used in the course.

**Quick Links**
- **Slides**: Put lecture slides (PDF, PPTX, or source files) in the `slides/` directory.
- **Assignments**: Put homework and coursework in the `assignments/` directory.
- **Code**: Put runnable code examples and solutions in the `code/` directory.
- **Exams**: Put past exam papers and solutions in the `exams/` directory.

If these directories don't exist yet, you can create them to keep the repository organized.

**Suggested Repository Structure**
- `slides/` — lecture slides (PDF, PPTX, LaTeX, reveal.js sources)
- `assignments/` — problem sets, handouts, and submission instructions
- `code/` — example implementations, scripts, and helpers (organized by assignment)
- `exams/` — midterms, finals, and solutions
- `notes/` — supplementary notes or reading lists
- `README.md` — this file

How to view or add materials
- To view slides: open `slides/*.pdf` with any PDF viewer or `slides/*.pptx` with PowerPoint / Keynote.
- When adding source files (LaTeX, Markdown, Jupyter notebooks), include a generated PDF or brief build instructions in the same folder.
- For code samples, add a small `README` inside `code/<assignment>/` documenting how to run the examples (required language, minimal commands).

Contribution and Usage
- If you are a student: Please follow submission instructions given by the instructor. Do not upload solutions to public repositories unless explicitly permitted.
- If you are a collaborator or instructor: Add or update materials, and keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `week03-graph-algorithms.pdf`).
- To contribute: fork, edit or add files, and open a pull request. Include a short description of changes.

License and Attribution
- This repository includes a `LICENSE` file. Check it for permitted uses and redistribution rules.

Contact
- For questions about course content or repository structure, open an issue or contact the repository owner.

Next steps
- Create the directories listed above and add your slides and coursework files.
- If you want, I can scaffold the suggested folders now and add a template `code/README.md` or an example assignment layout — tell me which you'd prefer.
